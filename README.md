- CES(Consumer Electronics Show) is one of the most popular place for meeting the future.
    Companies which spearheads new technology introduce their products which might make foundational changes in our lifes.
    For example, We could find self-driving cars, TVs with curved screens, and action cameras in 2016 CES.
    
    As technologies develop, we can easily record and upload videos with low price.
    
- What we see now is exactly the same city back in the 18th century.
  It's a colonial city and well-preserved. We can enjoy this city in all aspects.
  Vistors can have good food, shopping and enjoy the nature. 

  As I get older, I wish more that time stands still.

  I think Seoul is the major tourist attraction.
  I recomment it to people who want to enjoy modern city but different moods from western city like New York.
  The city is never sleep and very safe as well.
